# ML_from_scratch
Implementation of some ML algorithms using python and numpy

First - SoftmaxRegressor:

Implementation of Mini-batch Gradient Descent for Softmax Regression.
Tested on text classification task. 
For this task I made additional custom transformer, to make word-vectors of given text.
(Design compatible with Scikit-Learn pipelines).
